Non-technical people like excel but the technical person and the Internet like JSON. This scrip bridge the gaps. 
It can convert an csv file (save as .csv for an excel document) containing GB2312 encoding character to an UTF-8 encoded JSON file.

Usage:
./toJson xxx.csv
Output: xxx.json



MORE:
1.The first row will be the keys of json object

Containts:
1. Hardcode for post-processing certain fields , e.g: FileName
   Suppose the value in original csv file is "index.jpg" ,the json value will be "${ROOT_URI}/index.jpg"

   This is a useful feature and you can modify it to suit your needs.
